Notes:
The included chromedriver did not function properly - I updated it on my local machine, but left it unchanged in the repo, since I'm
assuming that is the version you have set up. 

Screenshots are saved to the default directory, which is in the folder where mix is stored. 
Additional notes about individual tests are stored in the elixir_sdet_excersice_test folder.
